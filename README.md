# retnur
JS framework for a 2D, turn-based strategy game inspired by the Heroes of Might and Magic series.

The name 'retnur' is an anagram of "turner" and "return", two other terms that reflect the turn-based style of games and reusable framework nature of the project.  Both of those seem generic or associated with other things, so I have gone with the more distinctive retnur.

Planned phases:
1. Something that shows up in which you can choose a leader
2. another screen that allows you to move your hero around a map
3. interactions with things in the map that modify state within your leader
4. battle screen
5. troop stacks and battle sequencing

After phase 5 I will take a step back and evaluate.

The long-term vision is to make the game highly configurable with some sensible presets.

I haven't worked much with JS or UIs, nor have I ever designed or developed a non-trivial game from scratch, so this will be a learning journey for me.

**Current status** (_as of 10/2/2024_): Picking things back up; tentatively decided to use Pixi.js for now.

_Update 2/5/2019_: evaluating 2D JS game engines (Phaser, Cocos2d, Construct2)
