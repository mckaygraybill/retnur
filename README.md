# retnur
JS framework for a 2D, turn-based strategy game inspired by the Heroes of Might and Magic series.

Retnur is simply an anagram of "turner" and "return", two other terms that reflect (even if only slightly) the turn-based style of games and reusable framework nature of the project.  Both of those seem generic or associated with other things, so I have gone with the more distinctive retnur.
