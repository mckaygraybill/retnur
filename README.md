# retnur
JS framework for a 2D, turn-based strategy game inspired by the Heroes of Might and Magic series.

Retnur is simply an anagram of "turner" and "return", two other terms that reflect (even if only slightly) the turn-based style of games and reusable framework nature of the project.  Either of those seem too generic to be very memorable or associative, so I have gone with retnur.
