# retnur
JS framework & sample implementation for a 2D, turn-based strategy game inspired by the Heroes of Might and Magic series. Detailed instructions will be included on how to customize your own game with graphics, configurations, agents (NPCs), etc.

The name 'retnur' is an anagram of "turner" and "return", two other terms that reflect the turn-based style of games and reusable framework nature of the project.  Both of those seem generic or associated with other things, so I have gone with the more distinctive retnur.

Planned phases:
1. Screen in which you can choose a leader
2. Additional screen that allows you to move your hero around a map
3. Interactions with things in the map that modify state within your leader
4. Turns and random AI agent
5. Battle screen
6. Troop stacks and battle sequencing
7. Victory/defeat

After phase 7 I will take a step back and evaluate. Some ideas for future consideration:

* auto-battle
* path suggestion, including across turns
* fog of war
* built-in NPC logic
* multiple leaders
* ability to combine/split leaders or groups

The long-term vision is to make the game highly configurable with some sensible presets.

I haven't worked much with JS or UIs, nor have I ever designed or developed a non-trivial game from scratch, so this will be a learning journey for me. If you want to contribute or collaborate you are welcome to reach out.

**Current status** (_as of 10/2/2024_): Picking things back up; tentatively decided to use Pixi.js.

_Update 2/5/2019_: evaluating 2D JS game engines (Phaser, Cocos2d, Construct2)
